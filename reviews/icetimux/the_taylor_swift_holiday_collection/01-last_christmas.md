## Grade: 88/100
### Reviewer: icetimux (02-01-201)

Taylor Swift really captures the feelings of the Christmas holiday with this classic song originally written by George Michael. 

Despite this song not being an original by Taylor Swift, it definitely feels like it is. With country hints added to the original pop song it really creates a warm homey holiday vibe. 

With Taylor's vocals and slight modifications to the song, it breathes a new freshness to the classic holiday tune making it feel new and exciting.
